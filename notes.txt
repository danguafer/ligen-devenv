1. IF WE RUN CARGO CLEAN AND CARGO BUILD, THE DYLIB ISN'T BEING FOUND (PROBABLY IT IS IN A INTERMEDIATE FOLDER BEFORE GOING TO TARGET?)
2. HOW CAN WE FIND OUT WHERE IS THE TARGET FOLDER?
3. WE NEED TO DEFINE THE DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOCATION
4. WE NEED TO VERIFY IF GENERATOR_GENERATE AND GENERATOR_NEW ARE PRESENT IN THE DLL FILE
5. WE NEED TO COMPLY WITH CONSTNESS, VALUE PASSING (RUST MOVE) AND REFERENCES
6. WE NEED TO FORCE GENERATOR NEW AND GENERATE SIGNATURE
7. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MULTIPLE GENERATORS (C, C++, UE4Blueprint)
8. CHECK CONSTNESS IN C++
